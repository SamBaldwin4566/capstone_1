# Capstone Project 1 - Variables and Control Structures
This was my first project during my Web Development Bootcamp and came quite early on. We had covered the very basics of JavaScript; variables, datatypes, control structures, operators and switch statements. But I would like to share my coding journey and this is an appropriate place to start. The idea behind the task was to consolidate all the knowledge I gained and apply it to create a temperature metric convert dependent on the input of the users choice. At this point of the bootcamp we had only covered JavaScript and very minimal HTML. As I want to show my coding journey I have left the HTML very basic please see my future projects to see what I can do with HTML/CSS.
